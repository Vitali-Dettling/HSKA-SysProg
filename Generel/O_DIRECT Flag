    O_DIRECT (Since Linux 2.4.10)
              Try to minimize cache effects of the I/O to and from this file.  In
              general this will degrade performance, but it is useful in special
              situations, such as when applications do their own caching.  File I/O
              is done directly to/from user space buffers.  The O_DIRECT flag on its
              own makes at an effort to transfer data synchronously, but does not
              give the guarantees of the O_SYNC that data and necessary metadata are
              transferred.  To guarantee synchronous I/O the O_SYNC must be used in
              addition to O_DIRECT.  See NOTES below for further discussion.
